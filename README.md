# SmartTV app
## Front-end: `TypeScript + ReactJS / React-Router-Dom / react-transition-group`

Resolution: 16:9.
The app has three different pages: banner page, number page, final page. The transition between routes is animated using React Transition Group.
1. The Banner page has a banner where we have a text with an offer to buy a dog to your child;
2. The Number page includes a `KeyBoard` component. The `KeyBoard` component allows you to type phone number using mouse, keyboard: arrow keys or digit keys. If you wish to select a button press Enter, to delete press Backspace. In case of an incorrect number you can't send the phone number and you'll see an appropriate message;
3. The Final page tells the user that everything is okay and message was delivered.

## To start the app:
1. Download the files from repository;
2. Run npm install, then npm/yarn start.
